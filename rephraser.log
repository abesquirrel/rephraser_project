Verizon-Specific LTE Bands\nVerizon primarily operates on LTE bands 2, 4, 5, 13, and 66.\n\nThe XT1955-5 is optimized for these bands, ensuring strong coverage and VoLTE support.\n\nSome global variants may support LTE but lack Band 13, which is Verizon’s primary LTE coverage band.\n\n3. Preloaded Verizon Software &amp; Branding\nThis model often comes with preinstalled Verizon apps and may feature Verizon-specific firmware.\n\nIt might have Verizon splash screens and default settings that prioritize Verizon’s network features.\n\n4. Locked to Verizon (Initially)\nIf purchased through Verizon, the device is usually locked to the network for 60 days, preventing use on other carriers until it’s eligible for unlocking.\n\nEven after unlocking, due to its CDMA-specific configuration, it may not work optimally on networks like AT&amp;T or T-Mobile, which primarily use GSM.\n\n5.

There are no active restrictions visible on the line from our end.\n\n**Action Taken / Recommendations:**  \n- We **recommend keeping network selection set to automatic**, as this allows the phone to choose the most compatible roaming partner available.  \n- Given that the **last successful roaming experience was with a different device**, we **suspect the current phone may not be fully compatible** with the local networks in Australia or may have different network preferences set.\n\n**Next Steps for the Customer:**  \n- Please confirm **exactly when was the last time roaming worked in Australia**, and if possible, specify **what phone was used at that time**.  \n- On the current device, please verify that **data roaming is enabled** and that **all bands/frequencies required for roaming are supported**.\n\nWith this information, we can better determine whether the issue is device-related or if further provisioning adjustments are needed.\n\n**Regards,**  \nPaul R'], ['the device sis at&amp;t branded and is likelt yo have CSC restrictions.and also the coverage at his location seems to be severely limited making things even harder for the customer, and i would like to insist having a different device after confiminf the CSC', '---\n\n**Hello,**\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe current device is **AT&amp;T branded** (Model: SM-G991UZAAATT), which strongly suggests that it may carry **CSC restrictions** that affect roaming and network compatibility—especially outside the U.S.  \nAdditionally, we’ve identified that **coverage at the customer’s current location is severely limited**, which complicates consistent connectivity even further.\n\n**Action Taken / Recommendation:**  \n- Please **confirm the CSC on the device** by dialing `*#1234#` and providing the full string (AP/CP/CSC) so we can verify its configuration.\n- Due to the combination of **limited local coverage** and **potential CSC locks**, we **strongly recommend testing a different, fully unlocked and non-carrier-branded device**, ideally one known to support international roaming and local Australian bands.\n\nThis would help isolate the issue and ensure better compatibility for roaming and overall connectivity.\n\n**Regards,**  \nPaul R'], ['the device sis at&amp;t branded SM-G973UZBAATT\n and is likelt yo have CSC restrictions.and also the coverage at his location seems to be severely limited making things even harder for the customer, and i would like to insist having a different device after confiminf the CSC', '---\n\n**Hello,**\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe customer&#x27;s device is **AT&amp;T branded (Model: SM-G973UZBAATT)**, which means it is very likely configured with **AT&amp;T-specific CSC settings**. These settings can limit compatibility with other carriers, particularly affecting roaming and VoLTE registration.  \nAdditionally, the **coverage at the customer’s location is severely limited**, further degrading the experience and making troubleshooting more difficult.\n\n**Action Taken / Recommendation:**  \n- Kindly ask the customer to dial `*#1234#` and share the **full CSC string (AP/CP/CSC)** so we can confirm the current configuration.\n- Given the combination of **CSC restrictions** and **poor signal availability**, I would strongly recommend the customer test service using a **different, factory-unlocked device**—ideally not branded by AT&amp;T or any U.S. carrier.\n\nThis will help determine whether the root cause is the device itself or the environmental/network limitations.\n\n**Regards,**  \nPaul R']]
